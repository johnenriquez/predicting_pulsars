# Pulsar Predictions

## About the project

As a way to sharpen my data science skills and practice publishing the insights gained, I've pulled sample astronomical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to explore using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Check out [the notebook](https://github.com/johnenriquez/predicting_pulsars/blob/master/predicting_pulsars.ipynb) for the full story.
